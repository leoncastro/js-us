# Facebook moderation helper

This script adds a button in the blue header of "facebook.com" (see image 1).  
Clicking that button brings a menu with six commands (see image 2) to help moderators in groups/pages on facebook.  
You can mark usernames with red/orange text colors.  
All data is stored in the localStorage in your browser, but there are commands to save/load to your local filesystem.  

Menu commands:

1. Mark as red (banned).
2. Mark as orange (warning).
3. Delete actual database.
4. Download actual database to a file.
5. Upload database from file and replace actual database.
6. Upload database from file and merge with actual database.
  
Every marked user got a small icon near their names (red or orange), to let you delete their marks and to show a tooltip with the date and moderator.
